<p>I am an evolutionary biologist with strong focus on trait evolution to understand the evolutionary processes and biodiversity patterns in medicinal species, scientifically supporting traditional knowledge, to ultimately improve health. To achieve this, I work with museum collections and modern samples using phylogenomic and chromatographic approaches.</p>

<p>Currently, I am a Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie PhD fellow in the <a href="https://evogenomics.snm.ku.dk/research-groups/roensted_group/">Natural History Museum of Denmark</a> and an early stage researcher in the <a href="https://www.plantid.uio.no/">Plant.ID project</a>. Originally from Peru, where I obtained my bachelors in Genetics and Biotechnology, then I moved to China to study my masters in Bionformaticsâ€¦</p>
