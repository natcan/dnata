As part of the JEP 40 years, our new paper explores chemically annotated _Cinchona_ bark collections (more than 150 years ago!) with currrent day HPLC technologies.
We found that the alkaloid content estimations, including quinine and cinchonine, were similar with historical chemical analysis and HPLC. 

How awesome is that?
